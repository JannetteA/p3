## Description
The goal of this project is to give students hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project students demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:

Creating a new Laravel application.
Installing and using Composer packages.
Routing basics.
Views.
Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.

## Tasks
1) Create a web application called Developer's Best Friend which includes a Lorem Ipsum Generator and a Random User Generator.

2) The landing page includes a description of the app with either links to the two tools, or the two tools are present on the page.

3) The tools should be powered by HTML forms and the user can specify how many paragraphs they want and how many users they want.

4) At least one external package is used in the project.  The package could be used to help generate the lorem ipsum text, generate the random users or the package assists the application in some other way.  The package is a new one that was not discussed in class.

5) The forms are checked by server-side validation and users are given feedback when their data input is invalid. In order7 to address this task, we follow the guidance in Lecture 7 which discusses validation with Laravel.
