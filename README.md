# Project Name: P3: Laravel Basics

## Live URL
http://p3.nowihavetime.com/

## Description
The goal of this project is to give students hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project students demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:

1) Creating a new Laravel application.

2) Installing and using Composer packages.

3) Routing basics.

4) Views.

5) Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.

## Tasks
1) Create a web application called Developer's Best Friend which includes a Lorem Ipsum Generator and a Random User Generator.

2) The landing page includes a description of the app with either links to the two tools, or the two tools are present on the page.

3) The tools should be powered by HTML forms and the user can specify how many paragraphs or users they want.

4) At least one external package is used in the project.  The package could be used to help generate the lorem ipsum text, generate the random users or the package assists the application in some other way.  The package is a new one that was not discussed in class.

5) The forms are checked by server-side validation and users are given feedback when their data input is invalid. In order to address this task, we follow the guidance in Lecture 7 which discusses validation with Laravel.

## Details for Teaching Team
I used a hospital ICU theme because my father was in the ICU for 18 days starting on 10/2 and that is the only thing that I could related to while working on this project. I visited daily and I learned a lot in the ICU in the same way that I have learned a lot in this class.  (By the way, my father made huge progress and is now in therapy, almost ready to go home!). 

Overall, I kept this project very simple while trying to meet all the criteria.  I reviewed the Rubric carefully and the overall project instructions.  


## Outside code
I used a lot of the examples from class, mainly from lecture 6 and lecture 7. For example, master.blade.php is basically the same code provided in the lecture content.  The basic forms are also from the examples in class. The echo syntax using the paragraph argument was obtain from examples in Stackoverflow.com and the packages used  were found in Packagist.org.
